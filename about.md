Inclusive Design Patterns is a community-driven catalog of resources for building software that affirms the identity and respects the dignity of its users.

<!-- TODO: elaborate on this a bit -->

We draw inspiration from projects like [This Is Responsive](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/) and [A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/); we see designing for inclusivity as a parallel set of challenges alongside progressive enhancement, accessibility and localization -- the web is for everyone, not just the people who are traditionally represented.

There's a tremendous amount of existing work in this space -- much of it done by marginalized people -- and our project catalogs this work. Our goal in collecting these patterns is to help people discover this work and understand it in context, and introduce developers to inclusive patterns that they wouldn't have otherwise sought out.

<!-- TODO: inclusive design often starts with a single "champion" in a company -->

Just as with accessibility and progressive enhancement, inclusive design goes beyond code. Most of the work for inclusive design requires inclusive policies and processes to support the code, and we provide examples for those as well.
